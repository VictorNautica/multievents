Most of the data were admittedly initially collected from Wikipedia (during the days of where my R skills were lacking), then later cross-checked and verified from official websites including \url{http://www.euromeetings.org/history.asp?id=8}, \url{https://www.sports-reference.com}, \url{https://www.iaaf.org}, \url{https://www.decathlon2000.com/}, with additional testing done through converting raw measurements and times through own functions.
